    The Addresses API validates and corrects address information to improve package delivery service and pricing. This suite of APIs provides different utilities for addressing components. The ZIP Code&#8482; lookup finds valid ZIP Code&#8482;(s) for a City and State. The City/State lookup provides the valid cities and states for a provided ZIP Code&#8482;. The Address Standardization API validates and standardizes USPS&#174; domestic addresses, city and state names, and ZIP Code&#8482; in accordance with USPS&#174; addressing standards. The USPS&#174; address standard includes the ZIP + 4&#174;, signifying a USPS&#174; delivery point, given a street address, a city and a state.

        Codes that indicate how to improve the address input to get a better match.
        
        Code `32` will indicate "Default address: The address you entered was found but more information is needed (such as an apartment, suite, or box number." The recommended change would be to add additional information, such as an apartment, suite, or box number, to match to a specific address.
        
        Code `22` will indicate "Multiple addresses were found for the information you entered, and no default exists." The address could not be resolved as entered and more information would be needed to identify the address.
